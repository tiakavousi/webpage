## Key Features

### RBAC Analysis
KubeKitty continuously monitors Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) configurations:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

### Network Policies

KubeKitty helps you implement secure network policies:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: default-deny
spec:
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
```

## Best Practices

1. Always follow the principle of least privilege
2. Regularly audit RBAC permissions
3. Implement network segmentation

> **Note**: Regular security audits are recommended to maintain cluster security.
